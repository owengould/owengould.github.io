In my spare time, I enjoy staying active through running, weightlifting, and pickleball. 

I also love music: I play the drums and collect albums on CD. My favorite artists include Death Grips, Miles Davis (particularly the era of the Second great Quintet from 1961-1968), and billy woods.

Finally, I have committed to watching some of the major prestige dramas from the “Golden Age of Television.” Currently, I am working through The Sopranos.

More to come later!

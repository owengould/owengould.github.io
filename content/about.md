I am a fourth-year [mathematics major](https://www.grinnell.edu/academics/majors-concentrations/math) with a [concentration in statistics](https://www.grinnell.edu/academics/majors-concentrations/statistics) at [Grinnell College](https://www.grinnell.edu).

My undergraduate studies span probability theory, data science, and statistical/machine learning, and I code in Python and R.

I work as a peer mentor at Grinnell College’s [Data Analysis and Social Inquiry Lab](https://dasil.sites.grinnell.edu), a grader for the statistics department, and a member of the Statistics [SEPC](https://www.grinnell.edu/academics/majors-concentrations/education/committees) – a student government body that assists in the faculty hiring and review process within their respective departments, among other responsibilities.

At the moment, I am applying to graduate programs in Biostatistics. Feel free to contact me if you would like to discuss academia or about the field of biostatistics/heath data science!

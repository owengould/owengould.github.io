### Overview 

My primary research interests are stochastic processes and statistical/machine learning with applications in biology and public health.

### Iowa Summer Institute in Biostatistics 2025

In the summer of 2025, I joined the Iowa Summer Institute in Biostatistics. In addition to completing introductory biostatistics coursework and learning about the field through conversations with professors, graduate students, and researchers, I completed a research project under the advisement of the University of Iowa’s [Dr. Patrick Breheny](https://www.public-health.uiowa.edu/people/patrick-breheny/).

In this project, I performed high-throughput data analysis to understand the role of fluid shear stress on metastasis. By using modified t-tests that controlled for false positive rates and gene set enrichment analysis, we indicated groups of genes that could provide further avenues for oncology research. We presented our methods and results to the Iowa Summer Institute in Biostatistics Symposium.

### Grinnell Summer MAP 2024

In the summer of 2024, I worked on a Mentor-Advanced Project (MAP) under [Dr. Pratima Hebbar](https://www.grinnell.edu/user/hebbarpr) from the Grinnell College Mathematics Department.

In this research project, we used probability theory and Python simulations to investigate the long-term behavior of random walks, including simple random walks, biased random walks, alternating-time random walks, and random walks in random environments. I then used the Hidden Markov Model, an extension of the random walk, to create a statistical model of elephant movement based on data collected from South Africa’s Kruger National Park. Our group presented our results at the Grinnell College Mathematics Department’s Mathematics and Statistics Seminar Series, and I gave a poster presentation of our research at a meeting of the Iowa Chapter of the American Statistical Association.

You can find a writing sample of the statistical modeling process [here](../files/HMMs.pdf).
